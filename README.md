#  Brooklyn Airbnb Profitability Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project aims to **optimize Airbnb host profitability in Brooklyn** during the peak summer months (June–August 2025). A group of 50 independent Airbnb hosts partnered with our consulting firm to gain data-driven insights into pricing, availability, occupancy, and neighborhood performance. Using historical Airbnb data, we built an interactive Power BI dashboard and SQL-based analysis to inform their business strategies.
